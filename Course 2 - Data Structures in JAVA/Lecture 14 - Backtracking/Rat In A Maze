/*
You are given a N*N maze with a rat placed at maze[0][0]. Find whether any path exist that rat can follow to reach its destination i.e. maze[N-1][N-1]. Rat can move in any direc­tion ( left, right, up and down).
Value of every cell in the maze can either be 0 or 1. Cells with value 0 are blocked means rat can­not enter into those cells and those with value 1 are open.

Input Format
Line 1: Integer N
Next N Lines: Each line will contain ith row elements (separated by space)

Output Format :
The output line contains true if any path exists for the rat to reach its destination otherwise print false.

Sample Input 1 :
3
1 0 1
1 0 1
1 1 1
Sample Output 1 :
true

Sample Input 2 :
3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 1 1
Sample Output 2 :
false
