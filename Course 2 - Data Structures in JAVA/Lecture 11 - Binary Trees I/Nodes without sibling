/*
For a given Binary Tree of type integer, print all the nodes without any siblings.

Input Format:
The first and the only line of input will contain the node data, all separated by a single space. 
Since -1 is used as an indication whether the left or right node data exist for root, it will not be a part of the node data.

Output Format:
The only line of output prints the node data in a top to down fashion with reference to the root. 
Node data in the left subtree will be printed first and then the right subtree.
A single space will separate them all.

Constraints:
1 <= N <= 10^5
Where N is the total number of nodes in the binary tree.
Time Limit: 1 second

Sample Input 1:
5 6 10 2 3 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 9 -1 -1
Sample Output 1:
9    

Sample Input 2:
2 4 5 6 -1 -1 7 20 30 80 90 -1 8 9 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 -1 
Sample Output 2:
6 8 7 9  

Explanation of Sample Input 2:
In respect to the root, node data in the left subtree that satisfy the condition of not having a sibling would be 6 and 8, taken in a top-down sequence. 
Similarly, for the right subtree, 7 and 9 are the node data without any sibling.
Since we print the siblings in the left-subtree first and then the siblings from the right subtree, taken in a top-down fashion, we print 6 8 7 9.
