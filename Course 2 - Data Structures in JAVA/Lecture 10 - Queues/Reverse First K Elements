/*
For a given queue containing all integer data, reverse the first K elements. You have been required to make the desired change in the input queue itself.

Input Format :
The first line of input would contain two integers N and K, separated by a single space. 
They denote the total number of elements in the queue and the count with which the elements need to be reversed respectively.
The second line of input contains N integers separated by a single space, representing the order in which the elements are enqueued into the queue.

Output Format:
The only line of output prints the updated order in which the queue elements are dequeued, all of them separated by a single space. 
Note: You are not required to print the expected output explicitly, it has already been taken care of. Just make the changes in the input queue itself.
Contraints :
1 <= N <= 10^6
1 <= K <= N
-2^31 <= data <= 2^31 - 1
Time Limit: 1sec

Sample Input 1:
5 3
1 2 3 4 5
Sample Output 1:
3 2 1 4 5

Sample Input 2:
7 7
3 4 2 5 6 7 8
Sample Output 2:
8 7 6 5 2 4 3
